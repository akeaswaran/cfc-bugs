# College Football Coach Bug Tracker üêõ

Hey! Here's a helpful little bug tracker for known issues with [College Football Coach for iOS](https://akeaswaran.me/cfc-ios), so if you have a bug to report you can check the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab up above to see if it's already been reported. I'm just one guy working on CFC so I can't promise I'll be able to fix the bug in a report instantly, but I do really want to know about the bugs so I can fix them as soon as I can!

<sub><sup>This issue tracker, its description, and its templates were borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/christianselig">Christian Selig</a>'s [issue tracker](https://github.com/christianselig/apollo-bugs) for the [Apollo for Reddit app](https://apolloapp.io).</sup></sub>

### How do I report a bug?

To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is super fast (and free) to do.

Then, go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top, then select ‚ÄúNew Issue‚Äù and simply fill in the form. *Please* make sure you include as much of the requested information as possible, it helps me out a ton! Please be polite in the discussions as well.

### How do I find out if my bug has already been reported?

Go to the ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù tab at the top, and there's a search bar at the top so you can search to see if it's already been submitted. If not, report away! If it has been reported though feel free to add more information to the discussion, or you can tap the + button with the smiley to vote on it to indicate it affects you too.

### What can I do to help if the bug I'm having an issue with has already been reported?

A massive part of solving a bug is just about reproducing it, which just means being able to consistently make it happen. If I can't make it happen, it's super hard to solve! So if you can make it happen and try to figure out the steps that always make it happen, please post those as a comment on the discussion, it'll help so much!

### Why do I need to sign up for an account here?

GitHub's an awesome site that's really well-suited for bug tracking. It'll keep things more organized than having bug bug discussions, feature requests, memes, announcement posts, and more all in the subreddit. Having to sign up for an account is super quick though and helps cut down on spam, so it's worth it, trust me! [Sign Up](https://github.com/)

### What if I have a feature request, not a bug report?

~~We have a separate place for feature requests (for organization), check out https://apolloapp.io/feature-requests~~

TBA.

### Can I participate in discussions here?

Of course! But please try to stay on topic to the specific bug report, so contribute if you feel you can add extra information. If you just want to say "me too", use the + button with the smiley on a comment to indicate your reaction rather than creating another comment. This is unfortunately also not the place for off-topic conversation or memes. Also please try to be nice here within the discussions. :)

### Am I not allowed to post bugs to the subreddit (r/FootballCoach)?

You totally can if you feel like it'd be worthwhile for discussion or some other reason, but GitHub is the preferred place if you're able to (again, just to keep everything organized).
